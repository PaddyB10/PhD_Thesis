Tableau Dashboards: 

	AHE_SRO - Displays the anomalous Hall effect loops measured in both film and freestanding SrRuO3 for one sample (FM112).

	AHE_Zeros - Displays the height of the anomalous Hall effect loops measured for the freestanding SrRuO3 across a number of temperatures.

Picture:

	The full set of anomalous Hall loops found across a number of temperatures in freestanding SrRuO3. Picture is generated via the python script.

Python Script:

	Imports the measured data, cleans it, calculates the anomalous Hall resitivity, anit-symmetrises the data and plots it.

PDF:

	A pdf of the python script.
